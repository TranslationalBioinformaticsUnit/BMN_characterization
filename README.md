# BMN characterization
This repository is a summary of codes used in  [_Deep deconvolution of the hematopoietic stem cell regulatory microenvironment reveals a high degree of specialization and conservation between mouse and human_](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.17.452614v1).

### Preprocessing and Integration
The cells were filtered and integrated using Seurat

### Clustering


### Bootstrapping

To measure the robustness of the clusters, we customized an existing bootstrapping-based approach based on random forest [[REF1]](#ref1). See details below.

###### Summary of the bootstrapping strategy:
